# C++ Problem Solving Projects

## 📌 Repository Overview
This repository contains a collection of C++ programs solving a variety of algorithmic and programming problems. 
The projects are designed to help students and beginners practice **problem-solving, loops, arrays, functions, and object-oriented programming concepts**. 
It also covers common tasks like number manipulation, pattern printing, array operations, and basic math computations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++  
- Standard Template Library (STL) for some projects  
- Basic input/output and control structures  

## 🚀 Key Learning Outcomes
By working through these projects, you will learn:
- How to use **loops** (for, while) and conditional statements effectively
- Implement **functions** for code reusability
- Work with **arrays** and manipulate their data
- Solve problems like **prime numbers, perfect numbers, palindrome checks, and more**
- Practice **pattern printing and basic algorithms**
- Apply **basic math operations** in programming
- Gain experience with **user input validation and data handling**

## 📚 Projects Included
Some of the key types of projects in this repository include:
- **Number Manipulation:** Multiplication tables, sum of digits, reversing numbers, frequency of digits
- **Arrays & Collections:** Copy arrays, sum, average, min/max, counting positive/negative numbers
- **Patterns & Loops:** Printing number/letter patterns, inverted patterns, palindromes
- **Functions Practice:** Custom math functions like floor, ceil, sqrt, rounding
- **Encryption & Random Numbers:** Simple encryption/decryption and generating random numbers/keys

## 💡 How to Run
1. Open any `.cpp` file in Visual Studio, CodeBlocks, or another C++ IDE.  
2. Compile the file.  
3. Run and follow the prompts in the console.
